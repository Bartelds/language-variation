<h4>Discussion</h4>

<div class="text">
Cronbach Alpha (option -c) was introduced in <a href="leven.html">leven</a> version 1.48 and
<a href="giw.html">giw</a> version 0.12 (both release date 2004/10/27). This
code was broken until <a href="leven.html">leven</a> version 1.63 and
<a href="giw.html">giw</a> version 0.22 (both release date 2006/01/25). Does
that mean that all values for Cronbach Alpha calculated with those older
releases are wrong? Perhaps not.
<p>
The bug reared its ugly head unexpectedly while hacking the <b>leven</b> program that
resulted in much larger dialect differences than usual. A faulty test in the
code for Cronbach Alpha was harmless as long as string differences are less
than 1, which they usually are because of a normalisation. (Unless you added
your own normalisation function.) However, this seemed
to be a lucky coincidence with the way the compiler works, and not something to
rely on. Are you using a compiler that makes the bug harmless? You can test
this by running <b>bugtest</b>. If you are lucky, you get this message:
<pre>
    Bug did not manifest. You are probably safe.
</pre>
Probably safe. No guarantees.
