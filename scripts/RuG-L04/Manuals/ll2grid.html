<h4>Synopsis</h4>

    [<b>-o&nbsp;</b><em>filename</em>]
    [<b>-p</b>&nbsp;<em>float</em>]
    <em>longitude</em> <em>latitude</em> <em>filename</em>

<h4>Options</h4>

<div class="text">
<dl>
<dt><b>-o</b>  <em>filename</em>
<dd>output file

</div>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<div class="text">
This program maps coordinates from longitude and latitude onto a
rectangular projection. The result can be used for drawing maps.
(You should set the aspect ratio to 1 in the
<a href="mapconfig.html">Map configuration file</a>.) 
<p>
The arguments <em>longitude</em> and <em>latitude</em>
set the central focal point for the projection.
<p>
The program will process the input file as follows: Whenever a line
starts with two numbers, with nothing in between but spaces or tabs,
these numbers are considered to be coordinates in degrees of longitude
and latitude, and converted to new coordinates. These new coordinates,
and the remaining part of the input line is printed to the output file.
Other lines are copied from input to output unchanged.
<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Lines that were straight will get curved. If you have
long straight line segments, delimited only by end points, you need to
split those lines up into smaller segments first.

<h4>Projection</h4>

<div class="text">
The option <tt><b>-p</b></tt> controls how the distortion that results
from projecting a curved surface onto a flat surface is handled. It
should be a value between 0 and 1.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt><b>-p 0</b></tt>
<dd>The projecting will look as the earth is seen from space, high above
the focal point. (As high as needed to allow you to see a full
hemisphere.)
<p>
The scaling along the edge of all circles with the focal point as centre
will be identical, regardless of the radius of the circle.
<p>
The scaling along the lines radiating from the centre outwards
will be distorted. They are shortened farther from the centre.
<p>
This projection will only allow you to map half the surface of the
earth, before the projection folds onto itself along the edges.
<p>
<dt><tt><b>-p 1</b></tt>
<dd>
The scaling along the edge of circles with the focal point as centre
will vary with the radius of the circle.
<p>
The scaling along the lines radiating from the centre outwards
will be without distortion.
<p>
This projection allows you to map the entire surface of the earth onto a
single map.
</dl>
<p>
Use a value between 0 and 1 for a mixed distortion.
<p>
The maps below show examples of projections for several values of
<tt><b>-p</b></tt>. The focal point is indicated by the blue spot.
