<h4>Description</h4>

<div class="text">
permutate linguistic data
</div>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div class="text">
<b>perfiles</b> [<b>-n</b> <em>int</em>] [<b>-r</b>]
<em>inputfiles</em>
</div>

<h4>Options</h4>

<div class="text">
<dl>

<dt><b>-n</b> <em>int</em>
<dd><a href="#nolab">No labels.</a> Fixed number of lines in all input files

<dt><b>-r</b>
<dd><a href="#raw">Raw input</a> (no quotes, no escape sequences)
</dl>
</div>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<div class="text">
Suppose you have a set of files with linguistic data. Each file contains all
      the linguistic items for a single location. The Levenshtein program
      requires its input to be grouped such that each input file contains one
      linguistic item in all its variations in all locations. This program can
      rearrange the data.
<p>
Schematicly, suppose you have two files, <b>Place1</b> and <b>Place2</b>:
<p>
<b>Place1</b>
<pre>
    word1 pronunciation11a pronunciation11b  # two different pronunciations of the same word
    word2 pronunciation21
    word3 pronunciation31
</pre>
<p>
<b>Place2</b>
<pre>
    word1 pronunciation12
    # no pronunciation for the second word
    word3 pronunciation32
</pre>
<p>
Run this command...
<pre>
    perfiles Place1 Place2
</pre>
... and you will end up with three files, <b>word1.per</b>, <b>word2.per</b>,
      and <b>word3.per</b>:
<p>
<b>word1.per</b>
<pre>
    : Place1
    - pronunciation11a
    - pronunciation11b
    : Place2
    - pronunciation12
</pre>
<p>
<b>word2.per</b>
<pre>
    : Place1
    - pronunciation21
</pre>
<p>
<b>word3.per</b>
<pre>
    : Place1
    - pronunciation31
    : Place2
    - pronunciation32
</pre>

<h4>Details</h4>

<div class="text">
As a precaution, the program won't overwrite existing files. This means you
      have to run the program once on all input files in one go. You have to
      give all file names as arguments, or use wild-cards that match all input files.
<p>
As you can see in the example above, input files can have, for each item,
      any number of pronunciations. You don't have to include all
      pronunciations for a single item on one line. You can split them over
      several lines, as long as you start each line with the correct label.
<p>
Labels and pronunciations are all separated by white space (spaces or tabs).
<p>
Anything starting with a hash (#) is treated as a comment, and the remainder of
	the line is ignored.
<p>
In both labels and further data, there are a few special token combinations:
<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
	<thead>
	  <tr bgcolor="white"><th>input<th>output
	  </tr>
	</thead>
<tr><td><tt>\"</tt><td><tt>"</tt>
<tr><td><tt>\#</tt><td><tt>#</tt>
<tr><td><tt>\\</tt><td><tt>\</tt>
<tr><td><tt>\</tt><i>space</i><td><i>space</i>
</table>
<p>
You can put quotes around items (labels or further data), in which case you can
	put spaces inside items without having to escape them. These are all
	identical:
<pre>
    abc\ def
    "abc def"
    "abc\ def"
</pre>
Note that trailing spaces are always removed, so these are the same:
<pre>
    "ghi"
    "ghi "
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Use of options</h4>

<div class="text">
<a name="nolab"></a>
<b>-n</b> <em>number</em> : No labels
<p>
If the input files don't have labels, you must use this option. The number says
	how many lines there are in each input file. Each input file should have exactly
	this number of lines, and each file should have the data in the same
	order. If you don't have data for an item, include a blank line. If you
	have multiple pronunciations for one word, put them all on one line.
Names for output files are made from input line numbers. 

<p>

<a name="raw"></a>
<b>-r</b> : Raw input
<p>
If you use this option, all input data will be treated as is. Quote and
	backslash have no special meaning and are copied to the output files
	unchanged. You cannot have spaces in an item. Note: anything starting
	with a hash (#) is still treated as a comment, and the remainder of the
	line will be ignored.
