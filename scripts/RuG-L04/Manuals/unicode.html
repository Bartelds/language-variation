<h2>Unicode</h2>
how to use Unicode in the programs <a href="leven.html">leven</a>,
<a href="features.html">features</a>, and <a href="xstokens.html">xstokens</a>
</center>


<h4>General</h4>

<div class="text">
Most programs treat data as 8-bit strings, without assumption of
encoding. There are two exceptions:
<ul>
<li>Labels will be decoded as ISO-8859-1, when used to put strings in
	  PostScript images.
<li>The <a href="leven.html">leven</a> program optionally decodes dialect data (not the labels in
  the datafiles) as UTF-8.
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Using Unicode in program <em>leven</em></h4>

<div class="text">
You can put Unicode strings in datafiles encoded as lists of numbers,
      preceded by a plus sign, but this is not easily human readable.
<p>
You can also put strings in datafiles as strings encoded in UTF-8. You
	need to tell <a href="leven.html">leven</a> about this by
	including this line in each datafile effected:
<pre>
    %utf8
</pre>
This line effects the rest of the datafile, so be sure to put it at the top.
Labels in datafiles will always be interpreted as raw 8-bit strings.
</div>

<h4>Using Unicode in program <em>features</em></h4>

<div class="text">
The <a href="features.html">features</a> program processes all files as 8-bit
    data, but this applies to datafiles as well as feature definition
    file. So you can use any character encoding you like, single byte or
    multi byte. But you cannot use the UTF-7 encoding, for obvious reasons.

</div>

<h4>Using Unicode in program <em>xstokens</em></h4>

<div class="text">
For <a href="xstokens.html">xstokens</a> the same applies as for the
      <b>features</b> program.
