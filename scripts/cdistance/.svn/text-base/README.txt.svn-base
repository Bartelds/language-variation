Support files for "Comparing Clusterings in Space" (Coen et
al. 2010), which was presented at ICML 2010.

The main procedure for computing Clustering Distance is in cdistance.m
Its inputs are two cell arrays representing two clusterings.
Additional usage information can be found in the function help.

There are four examples included in this distribution. Each of them 
can be run and visualized on its own simply by invoking the M-file. They are

example_1.m (Generates Figure 1 in the paper)
example_2.m (Generates Figure 4c in the paper)
example_3.m (Generates Figure 5 in the paper)
example_4.m (Generates Figure 6 in the paper)

The simplest way to experiment with the code is by modifying
example_4, which generates the clusterings directly, rather than
reading them from a file.  Following the outline in that file, define
the new data points and labels, construct clusterings using the
'clusterify()' function as indicated, and run CDistance on the
generated clusterings.

The data for the clusterings displayed in Table 1 (page 5) are
contained in the files:

comparison1.mat
comparison2.mat
comparison3.mat
comparison4.mat

Compiled MEX files are included for Windows and Unix platforms (32-bit
and 64-bit). In case of problems with these files, re-compile by
running the command "mex ot_mex.c" in MATLAB.
